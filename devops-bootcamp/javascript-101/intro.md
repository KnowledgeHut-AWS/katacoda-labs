# Learning JavaScript

## About JavaScript

- JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification
- JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions
- It was initially created to make Web Sites more interactive, i.e. it can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads
- The code is provided and executed as plain text, hence doesn’t need special preparation or compilation to run

We will show you how to run a simple JS program in a web page.
