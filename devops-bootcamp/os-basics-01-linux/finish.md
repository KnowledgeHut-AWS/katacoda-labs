## Done

Review this and run these labs over and over again until you get it.
Ask you instructor for help. Ask your friends and colleages for help. 
Write cheatsheets and notes and comments in the margins.

You have to memorise all of this and a lot more because what is written
here are the basics. The minimum I could get away with writing for an
introduction to linux. You won't have done it all in 2-days. It'll take
longer than that, so practice, practice, practice until you understand
it all and remember most of it. Then practice some more.

Trust me, this is important. Learn it.
