Now there will be mainly two options 

1. Discard these changes

2. Save the file and its changes

##### Discard the changes

If you want to discard a change then type `:q` followed by return /enter key. You may get a warning. If you want to quite of vi without saving is then type `:q!`.This lets you exit vi without saving any of the changes.


##### Save the file and its changes

If you want to save the content then type `:wq` followed by enter key.Easiest way to save the changes and exit is `ZZ`.If you want to save the file with a particular name, you can do so by specifying it after `:w filename`

Example

The following example replaces every occurrence (caused by the g at the end of the command) of apple with pear. 

`:%s/apple/pear/g`


Another Example


The following example removes the last character from every line in the file. Use it if every line in the file ends with ^M as the result of a file transfer.

Execute it when the cursor is on the first line of the file. 

`:%s/.$//`
