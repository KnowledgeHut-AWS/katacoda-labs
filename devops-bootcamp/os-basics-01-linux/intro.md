Linux is an open-source free operating system that is extremely popular and common. We have design lab is designed to give 
you just enough instruction to make you proficient enough to start self-guided learning on the topic. This will not make

When you see something you don't understand your first instinct will be to ask for help. It is better, in fact, if you look
for help alone and only ask for help should that fail you. [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) is an excellent resource
to search for help, though [Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/) is helpful too.
