# Writing an Express App

## Installation

Make sure you are the root directory 

`cd`{{Execute}}

Create the express App Root

`mkdir myexpress`{{execute}}

Change directory

`cd myexpress`{{execute}}

Run the following command to create a starter `package.json` file

`npm init`{{execute}}

This command prompts you for a number of things, such as the name and version of your application. For now, you can simply hit RETURN to accept the defaults for most of them, with the following exception:

`entry point: (index.js)`

Enter `app.js`, or whatever you want the name of the main file to be. If you want it to be index.js, hit RETURN to accept the suggested default file name. We will use index.js for our example

`npm install express --save`{{execute}}
