## Hands on training for professionals

This repository feeds our katacoda hands-on labs. The first lab we're developing is for our ongoing DevSecOps Bootcamp that is being run
in Saudi Arabia for the country's leading recent graduates on behalf of the SDA as part of the 2030 vision. However, this repo is structured
to support the other bootcamps that we are running, such as the Automated Testing and Full-Stack Development bootcamps.
